# Generated Test Cases - Organized Structure

This directory contains test cases generated by the Multi-Agent Test Automation Framework, organized by functional modules.

## 📁 Directory Structure

```
generated-test-cases/
├── authentication/         # Login, logout, authentication tests
├── account-management/     # Account creation, management tests  
├── transactions/          # Fund transfers, transaction tests
├── bill-pay/             # Bill payment and payee tests
└── README.md             # This file
```

## 🎯 File Naming Convention

Test case files follow the format: `{story-id}-tests.md`

**Examples:**
- `AUTH-001-tests.md` - Login authentication tests
- `ACCT-001-tests.md` - Account creation tests
- `TRANS-001-tests.md` - Fund transfer tests

## 📋 File Contents

Each test case file contains:

1. **Test Suite Summary** - Overview of test cases and priorities
2. **Requirements Analysis** - Actions, outcomes, and edge cases
3. **Generated Test Cases** - Detailed test steps and assertions
4. **Automation-Ready JSON** - Structured data for test execution

## 🚀 Usage

### Execute Test Cases from File
```bash
# Execute specific test case file
node dist/cli/story-cli.js execute generated-test-cases/authentication/AUTH-001-tests.md

# Execute using relative path
node dist/cli/story-cli.js execute ./generated-test-cases/bill-pay/BILL-001-tests.md
```

### Find Test Cases by Module
```bash
# List all test cases in authentication module
ls generated-test-cases/authentication/

# List all test cases in account management
ls generated-test-cases/account-management/
```

## 🔄 Automatic Generation

Test cases are automatically generated when running:

```bash
# These commands automatically save to organized structure
node dist/cli/story-cli.js test --story AUTH-001
node dist/cli/story-cli.js test --module authentication
```

## 📊 Integration with Framework
